:loop: a generative midi sequencer in the terminal

 - Represent port with quarter blocks characters
 - Each node can have 2 behaviors :
 	- An emitter behavior
 	- A trigger behavior
 	- A moving behavior ?

TODO:
 - signal brings context
 - add random note octave spread
 - add randomness on every note param
 - add note probability
 - add new emitters
  - Random (toss or dice)
  - Accumulation (trigger after x)
  - Zone for chord
 - add midi cc (note behavior?)
 - add key mapping
 - add file system

Unsure:
 - signals with different speeds

Names:
  - Nyll
  - KYVL
